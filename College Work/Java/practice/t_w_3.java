 3. Write a program to demonstrate the implementation of parameterized:
a. Methods.
b. Constructor.
3.1) A certain small bank intends to automate few of its banking operations for its customers.
Design a class by name mybankAccount to store the customer data having following details:
1.accountNumber 2. acctType 3. Name 4. Address 5. accountBalance
The class must have both default and parameterized constructors. Write appropriate method
to compute interest accrued on accountBalance based on accountType and time in years.
Assume 5% for S/B account 6.5% for RD account and 7.65 for FD account. Further, add two
methods withdrawAmount/depositAmount with amount as input to withdraw and deposit
respectively. The withdrawAmount method must report in-sufficient balance if
accountBalance falls below Rs. 1000.
TASK 1 : Build the class with appropriate member variables, constructors and methods.
TASK 2 : Instantiate three objects of above type and perform different operations on the
same.
TASK 3 : Write a function to display all the three customer details in a tabular form with
appropriate column headings.
