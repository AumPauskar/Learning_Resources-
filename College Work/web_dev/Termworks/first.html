    <h1>Welcome to F1 world</h1>
    <p>
      Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of
      international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars
      sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The
      World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World
      Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around
      the world since its inaugural season in 1950.<br />
      The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all
      participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a
      series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both
      purpose-built circuits and closed public roads. A points system is used at
      Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers,
      the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence,
      the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA.[2] The races must
      run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued
      by the FIA.
