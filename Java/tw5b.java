/*
 * )Implement the following class hierarchy. In the Cuboid class, override the
 * method
 * computeArea() and computePerimeter() of Rectangle class to compute the
 * surface area and
 * perimeter of a rectangle cuboid. Add a method computeVolume() in Cuboid class
 * to compute
 * volume of the cuboid. Assuming length, width and height as l, w and h
 * respectively,
 * 
 * ● formula to find the surface area = 2(lw) + 2(hl) + 2(hw)
 * ● formula to find the perimeter = 2l + 2w
 * ● formula to find the volume = l x w x h
