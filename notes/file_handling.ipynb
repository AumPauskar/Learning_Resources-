    "**What is a file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to store information on a persistent basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of files\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text files: files that make sense to humans.\n",
    "  - Eg. wrd,txt,json,py files\n",
    "- Binary files: Data is written in binary format.\n",

    "## Text File Handling in python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open a file\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(filename,mode) as file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Python, when working with text files, you can specify different modes to control how the file is opened and handled. The modes determine whether the file is read, written, or both, as well as the positioning within the file and other aspects of file handling. Here are the commonly used modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Mode (`'r'`)**: This is the default mode when opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of the file. If the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError` exception. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write Mode (`'w'`)**: This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (emptied) before writing the new data. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Append Mode (`'a'`)**: This mode allows you to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Read and Write Mode (`'r+'`)**: This mode allows both reading and writing operations on a file. It opens the file in a way that allows you to read from any position and write to any position. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'r+')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Write and Read Mode (`'w+'`)**: This mode allows both reading and writing operations, similar to `'r+'`. However, it truncates the file if it exists, just like `'w'` mode. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'w+')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Append and Read Mode (`'a+'`)**: This mode allows both reading and appending operations. It opens the file for reading and places the file pointer at the end of the file, so any writes will append to the existing content. Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'a+')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when working with file objects, it's good practice to close the file after you finish using it to free up system resources. You can do this by calling the `close()` method on the file object. Alternatively, you can use a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure that the file is automatically closed after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files in Python, there are various methods available for reading and writing data. Here's an explanation of the commonly used methods for file handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`read()`**: This method reads the entire content of the file as a single string and returns it. It's suitable for small files, but be cautious with large files as it loads the entire content into memory at once.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       content = file.read()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`readline()`**: This method reads a single line from the file and returns it as a string. It moves the file pointer to the next line for subsequent calls.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "       line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`readlines()`**: This method reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string represents a line. It's suitable for reading multiple lines at once.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`write()`**: This method writes a string to the file. It overwrites the existing content if the file is opened in write mode ('w') or creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       file.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`writelines()`**: This method writes a list of strings to the file, where each string represents a line. It doesn't add newlines automatically, so you need to include them if desired.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "       file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the methods mentioned above operate on strings. If you're working with non-text data, such as binary data, you'll need to use appropriate methods like `read()` and `write()` with binary mode ('rb', 'wb', 'ab').\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to handle file I/O errors appropriately, and close the file after you're done with it, either by using the `with open` statement or by explicitly calling the `close()` method.\n"
