    "# File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to store information on a persistent basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of files\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text files: files that make sense to humans.\n",
    "  - Eg. wrd,txt,json,py files\n",
    "- Binary files: Data is written in binary format.\n",
    "  - Eg. mp4, mp3, exe,object files etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text File Handling in python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open a file\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(filename,mode) as file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Python, when working with text files, you can specify different modes to control how the file is opened and handled. The modes determine whether the file is read, written, or both, as well as the positioning within the file and other aspects of file handling. Here are the commonly used modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Mode (`'r'`)**: This is the default mode when opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of the file. If the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError` exception. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write Mode (`'w'`)**: This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (emptied) before writing the new data. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Append Mode (`'a'`)**: This mode allows you to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Read and Write Mode (`'r+'`)**: This mode allows both reading and writing operations on a file. It opens the file in a way that allows you to read from any position and write to any position. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'r+')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Write and Read Mode (`'w+'`)**: This mode allows both reading and writing operations, similar to `'r+'`. However, it truncates the file if it exists, just like `'w'` mode. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'w+')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Append and Read Mode (`'a+'`)**: This mode allows both reading and appending operations. It opens the file for reading and places the file pointer at the end of the file, so any writes will append to the existing content. Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open('example.txt', 'a+')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when working with file objects, it's good practice to close the file after you finish using it to free up system resources. You can do this by calling the `close()` method on the file object. Alternatively, you can use a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure that the file is automatically closed after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files in Python, there are various methods available for reading and writing data. Here's an explanation of the commonly used methods for file handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`read()`**: This method reads the entire content of the file as a single string and returns it. It's suitable for small files, but be cautious with large files as it loads the entire content into memory at once.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       content = file.read()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`readline()`**: This method reads a single line from the file and returns it as a string. It moves the file pointer to the next line for subsequent calls.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "       line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`readlines()`**: This method reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string represents a line. It's suitable for reading multiple lines at once.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`write()`**: This method writes a string to the file. It overwrites the existing content if the file is opened in write mode ('w') or creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       file.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`writelines()`**: This method writes a list of strings to the file, where each string represents a line. It doesn't add newlines automatically, so you need to include them if desired.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "       file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the methods mentioned above operate on strings. If you're working with non-text data, such as binary data, you'll need to use appropriate methods like `read()` and `write()` with binary mode ('rb', 'wb', 'ab').\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to handle file I/O errors appropriately, and close the file after you're done with it, either by using the `with open` statement or by explicitly calling the `close()` method.\n"

    "## Binary File Handling\n",
    "1. Opening Binary Files:\n",
    "   - Use the `open()` function to open a binary file. Pass the file name and the appropriate mode as parameters.\n",
    "   - It's good practice to use the file within a `with` statement, which automatically handles file closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open(\"data.bin\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "       # File handling code goes here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary File Modes:\n",
    "   - \"rb\": Read mode in binary format. Allows reading data from the file.\n",
    "   - \"wb\": Write mode in binary format. Allows writing data to the file, truncating its contents if it already exists.\n",
    "   - \"ab\": Append mode in binary format. Allows writing data to the end of the file without truncating its existing contents.\n",
    "   - \"r+b\" or \"rb+\": Read and write mode in binary format. Allows both reading and writing data to the file.\n",
    "   - \"w+b\" or \"wb+\": Write and read mode in binary format. Allows both writing and reading data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reading from Binary Files:\n",
    "   - Use the `read()` method to read a specified number of bytes from the binary file.\n",
    "   - The returned data is in binary format and can be further processed or interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open(\"data.bin\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "       data = file.read(10)  # Read 10 bytes from the file\n",
    "       # Process the data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Writing to Binary Files:\n",
    "   - Use the `write()` method to write binary data to the file.\n",
    "   - The data to be written should be in binary format or serialized into a binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open(\"data.bin\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "       data = b'\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04'  # Example binary data\n",
    "       file.write(data)  # Write the binary data to the file\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Seek and Position:\n",
    "   - The `tell()` method returns the current position of the file pointer.\n",
    "   - The `seek()` method moves the file pointer to a specific position within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open(\"data.bin\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "       position = file.tell()  # Get the current position of the file pointer\n",
    "       file.seek(10)  # Move the file pointer to position 10\n",
    "       # File handling code goes here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Closing Binary Files:\n",
    "   - Use the `close()` method to manually close the binary file when you're done working with it.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, you can use the `with` statement, which automatically handles file closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = open(\"data.bin\", \"rb\")\n",
    "   # File handling code goes here\n",
    "   file.close()  # Manually close the file\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Error Handling:\n",
    "   - Wrap file handling operations in a try-except block to handle potential errors.\n",
    "   - Common errors include `FileNotFoundError`, `IOError`, or exceptions related to data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       with open(\"data.bin\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "           # File handling code goes here\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "   except IOError as e:\n",
    "       print(\"An error occurred while reading/writing the file:\", str(e))\n",

    "## CSV File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSV Files:\n",
    "   - CSV stands for \"Comma-Separated Values.\"\n",
    "   - CSV files store tabular data in plain text format, where each line represents a row, and columns are separated by delimiters (typically commas or semicolons).\n",
    "   - CSV files are widely used for data exchange between different applications and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reading CSV Files:\n",
    "   - Use the appropriate CSV reader provided by your programming language or library.\n",
    "   - The reader automatically handles parsing the CSV data and provides convenient access to rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "       for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "           # Access row data\n",
    "           column1 = row[0]\n",
    "           column2 = row[1]\n",
    "           # Process the data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Writing CSV Files:\n",
    "   - Use the appropriate CSV writer provided by your programming language or library.\n",
    "   - The writer handles formatting the data and writing it to the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n",
    "       csv_writer = csv.writer(file)\n",
    "       # Write rows\n",
    "       csv_writer.writerow(['Column1', 'Column2'])\n",
    "       csv_writer.writerow(['Value1', 'Value2'])\n",
    "       # Write multiple rows\n",
    "       rows = [['Value3', 'Value4'], ['Value5', 'Value6']]\n",
    "       csv_writer.writerows(rows)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specifying Delimiters and Quoting:\n",
    "   - CSV files can use delimiters other than commas, such as tabs or semicolons.\n",
    "   - The `delimiter` parameter can be used to specify the delimiter character while reading or writing CSV files.\n",
    "   - CSV files can also enclose fields in quotes to handle values containing delimiters.\n",
    "   - The `quotechar` parameter can be used to specify the quote character.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       csv_reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=';')\n",
    "       for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "           # Access row data\n",
    "           column1 = row[0]\n",
    "           column2 = row[1]\n",
    "           # Process the data\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n",
    "       csv_writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter='\\t', quotechar='\"')\n",
    "       # Write rows\n",
    "       csv_writer.writerow(['Column1', 'Column2'])\n",
    "       csv_writer.writerow(['Value1', 'Value,2'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handling Headers:\n",
    "   - CSV files often include a header row that labels the columns.\n",
    "   - The `next()` function can be used to skip the header row when reading the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "       headers = next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header row\n",
    "       for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "           # Access row data\n",
    "           column1 = row[0]\n",
    "           column2 = row[1]\n",
    "           # Process the data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. CSV Dialects:\n",
    "   - CSV dialects allow you to define custom settings for parsing and writing CSV files.\n",
    "   - The `csv.Dialect` class or its derived classes can be used to customize settings such as delimiters, quoting behavior, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "   class CustomDialect(csv.Dialect):\n",
    "       delimiter = ';'\n",
    "       quotechar = '\"'\n",
    "       quoting = csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL\n",
    "\n",
    "   with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       csv_reader = csv.reader(file, dialect=CustomDialect())\n",
    "       for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "           # Access row data\n",
    "           column1 = row[0]\n",
    "           column2 = row[1]\n",
    "           # Process the data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Error Handling:\n",
    "   - When reading or writing CSV files, handle potential errors such as file not found, permission issues, or invalid CSV format.\n",
    "   - Proper error handling ensures that your program gracefully handles exceptions and prevents crashes or data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "           csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "           for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "               # Access row data\n",
    "               column1 = row[0]\n",
    "               column2 = row[1]\n",
    "               # Process the data\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "   except csv.Error as e:\n",
    "       print(\"CSV error:\", str(e))\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(\"An error occurred:\", str(e))\n",
    "   ```\n"
