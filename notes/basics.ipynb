    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability with its clean syntax and uses indentation rather than braces for block structures, making it easy to write and understand. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**:Indentation is really important in python as we dont make use of {} for blocks._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python\n",
    "- Open Source\n",
    "- Easy to learn and understand the code\n",
    "- Expressive and Consice Code\n",
    "-  Multi-Purpose Language: Python is a versatile language used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning,  scientific computing, automation, and more. It provides extensive libraries and frameworks for different purposes.    \n",
    "- Cross- Platform Compatibility\n",
    "- Wide range of libraries for performing tasks\n",
    "- Great community support\n",
    "- Many Companies such as IBM, Slack, Google, EA Games use python\n"

    "## **Tokens**\n",
    "Tokens in Python are the smallest units of meaningful code and are categorized into several types. Here’s a quick breakdown to include in your notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Keywords**\n",
    "   - Reserved words in Python that have a special meaning and cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "   - Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `class`, `return`, and `try`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 2. **Identifiers**\n",
    "   - Names given to variables, functions, classes, and other objects.\n",
    "   - Rules: Must start with a letter or underscore, can’t use Python keywords, and are case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Literals**\n",
    "   - Fixed values assigned to variables or constants.\n",
    "   - Types:\n",
    "     - **String literals**: Enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes (e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'World'`).\n",
    "     - **Numeric literals**: Include integers, floats, and complex numbers.\n",
    "     - **Boolean literals**: `True` and `False`.\n",
    "     - **Special literals**: `None` represents a null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Operators**\n",
    "   - Symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.\n",
    "   - Types:\n",
    "     - **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.\n",
    "     - **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.\n",
    "     - **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`.\n",
    "     - **Assignment**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.\n",
    "     - **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Punctuation/Separators**\n",
    "   - Characters that structure and organize code.\n",
    "   - Examples include commas `,`, colons `:`, parentheses `()`, and brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Variables**\n",
    "Variables are used to store data values in memory. They are created when a value is assigned to them and are destroyed when they go out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variable names must adhere to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore character.\n",
    "2. Subsequent characters in a variable name can be letters, numbers, or underscores.\n",
    "3. Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning \"myvar\" and \"MyVar\" are different variables.\n",
    "4. Variable names should be descriptive and not the same as any Python keywords or built-in functions, such as \"print\" or \"list\".\n",
    "5. Variable names should not start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of valid variable names in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- my_variable\n",
    "- another_variable\n",
    "- variable1\n",
    "- _this_is_a_valid_variable_name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some examples of invalid variable names in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1variable  # Cannot start with a number\n",
    "- my-var    # Cannot use hyphens\n",
    "- class     # Cannot use Python keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: Same rules apply for function names as well_\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Datatypes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Integer (`int`)**\n",
    "   - An integer is a whole number, positive or negative, without a decimal point.\n",
    "   - Can be of any length, constrained only by the memory available.\n",
    "   - Common operations include arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`).\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     age = 25\n",
    "     temperature = -15\n",
    "     print(type(age))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Float (`float`)**\n",
    "   - A float represents a number with a decimal point. It’s used for real numbers that require precision.\n",
    "   - Typically, floats are 64-bit, allowing representation of a wide range of decimal values.\n",
    "   - Supports arithmetic operations and rounding functions (`round()`, `math.floor()`, `math.ceil()`).\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   pi = 3.14159\n",
    "   distance = -42.5\n",
    "   print(type(pi))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Boolean (`bool`)**\n",
    "   - A Boolean represents a logical value, either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "   - Booleans are a subtype of integers, where `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` to `0`.\n",
    "   - Commonly used in conditional statements and comparisons.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     is_sunny = True\n",
    "     is_raining = False\n",
    "     print(type(is_sunny))  # Output: <class 'bool'>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **String (`str`)**\n",
    "   - A string is an immutable sequence of characters, used to represent text.\n",
    "   - Strings are enclosed in single (`'...'`), double (`\"...\"`), or triple quotes (`'''...'''` or `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` for multi-line strings).\n",
    "   - Supports indexing, slicing, and many built-in methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     greeting = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "     print(greeting[0])       # Output: H\n",
    "     print(greeting.upper())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD!\n",
    "     print(type(greeting))    # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "*To check the data type we can make use of the **type()** function.*\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "   - When an exceptional situation arises, an exception is raised, and the program's control flow is transferred to an exception handler.\n",
    "   - Exceptions help handle errors, respond to unexpected situations, and provide a mechanism for graceful program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Default Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Python provides a set of built-in exceptions to handle common errors and exceptional conditions.\n",
    "   - Examples of default exceptions include `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, and `IndexError`.\n",
    "   - Each exception has a specific meaning and can be caught and handled independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Python allows you to define custom exceptions to represent specific error conditions in your program.\n",
    "   - Custom exceptions are created by defining new classes that inherit from the *Exception* class or its subclasses.\n",
    "   - By creating custom exceptions, you can encapsulate specialized error handling logic and improve code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",

    "           raise CustomValueError(\"Invalid age value: age must be non-negative.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Exceptions can be handled using the `try-except` statement.\n",
    "   - The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the `except` block specifies the exception(s) to catch and how to handle them.\n",
    "   - Multiple `except` blocks can be used to handle different exceptions separately.\n",
    "   - Certainly! The `finally` block is a part of the `try-except` statement in Python that allows you to specify code that will be executed    regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. The `finally` block is optional and follows the `try` and `except` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The purpose of the `finally` block is to provide a place to clean up resources or perform any necessary actions that should always occur, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

    "In Python, exceptions are structured in a hierarchy that helps organize the different types of errors that can occur, allowing programmers to handle each error appropriately. At the top of this hierarchy is the `BaseException` class, which all other exceptions inherit from. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Hierarchy Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BaseException**: This is the ultimate base class for all exceptions. Directly inheriting from `BaseException` are some special types of exceptions used for system-level events:\n",
    "   - **SystemExit**: Raised by the `sys.exit()` function, used to exit the program.\n",
    "   - **KeyboardInterrupt**: Raised when the user interrupts program execution, typically by pressing `Ctrl+C`.\n",
    "   - **GeneratorExit**: Raised when a generator or coroutine is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   `BaseException` and its subclasses represent exceptions that often indicate the program should stop or pause. You generally don’t want to catch these in everyday error handling because they manage system-level events.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception**: The next level in the hierarchy and the base class for most errors you'll encounter in code. If you write `except Exception`, you can handle most runtime errors without catching `BaseException` subclasses like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, which is usually what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Inside `Exception`, there are various error categories that group similar types of errors together. These categories include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **ArithmeticError**: Base class for errors in arithmetic operations.\n",
    "     - **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when you attempt to divide by zero.\n",
    "     - **OverflowError**: Raised when a mathematical calculation exceeds the maximum limit for a numeric type.\n",
    "     - **FloatingPointError**: Raised when a floating-point operation fails (this is rarely seen in modern Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **LookupError**: Base class for errors when a look-up operation fails (e.g., trying to access an index or key that doesn’t exist).\n",
    "     - **IndexError**: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.\n",
    "     - **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives a valid type argument, but its value is inappropriate (e.g., passing a string to a function that requires an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **ImportError**: Raised when an import statement fails to find the module definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Exception Handling Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write `except Exception:`, Python will catch errors derived from `Exception` and ignore `BaseException` errors. This lets you manage most runtime issues without interfering with system-level events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `ZeroDivisionError` specifically handles division by zero.\n",
    "- A general `except Exception` would handle any other runtime errors not specifically named.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the exception hierarchy, you can target specific types of errors precisely, avoiding unwanted system-level errors and ensuring smooth control over your code's error-handling behavior."

    "\n",
    "2. **IndexError** is a subclass of `LookupError`, which also inherits from `Exception`. When you call `process_data(data, 10, 5)`, accessing an invalid index raises `IndexError`, which is handled by the specific `except IndexError` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ValueError** is a direct subclass of `Exception`. When you call `process_data(data, 1, 5)`, attempting to convert the string `\"hello\"` to an integer raises `ValueError`, which is caught by `except ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exception** as a general case: If any other unexpected errors occur, they’ll be caught by the generic `except Exception as e` block. This block won't catch system-level exceptions (like `KeyboardInterrupt`) because `Exception` doesn’t inherit from `BaseException`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\"—data structures consisting of fields and methods—to design applications and computer programs. OOP is centered on the concept of classes and objects, which help organize and structure code in a way that is easy to manage and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why OOP is Useful**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**:  \n",
    "   Code is organized into classes, which makes it easier to separate concerns and break down complex problems into manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reusability**:  \n",
    "   Classes and objects can be reused across multiple programs or different parts of the same program without rewriting code. Inheritance further allows classes to extend functionality of existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Organization**:  \n",
    "   OOP helps organize code logically by grouping related data and functions. This structure makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintainability**:  \n",
    "   Encapsulation and abstraction make it easier to update and maintain code without affecting other parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extensibility**:  \n",
    "   By using inheritance and polymorphism, new classes can extend existing ones, allowing for flexible and scalable designs.\n"

    "1. **Instance Attributes**: Unique to each object (e.g., `name` and `age` of a student).\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Purpose of Constructors\n",
    "A **constructor** is a special method in a class that is automatically called when a new object of that class is created. In Python, the constructor is the `__init__` method. Its main purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes with default or specified values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s create a `Student` class that uses the `__init__` method to initialize `name` and `age` for each student object:\n",

    "In this example:\n",
    "- When a `Student` object is created, the `__init__` method assigns values to `name` and `age` attributes based on the input provided.\n",

    "**Encapsulation** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that restricts direct access to certain components of an object. It allows us to control how data is accessed and modified by binding data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data together within a class. By keeping certain data private, encapsulation helps:\n",

In method overriding, a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a subclass object calls the overridden method, Python will execute the version in the subclass rather than the one in the superclass.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** in OOP is a technique for defining classes and methods that act as a blueprint for other classes. It focuses on hiding the implementation details while exposing only the essential features to the user. By using abstraction, you can ensure that subclasses implement specific behaviors, which enhances modularity and reduces code duplication.\n",

    "An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can include both fully implemented methods and methods that are only declared but not implemented (abstract methods). The subclasses of an abstract class are required to provide implementations for its abstract methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Magic methods** (also known as **dunder methods**, short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python that enable customization of how objects of a class behave with built-in operations. Magic methods start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__add__`). They allow you to define how objects interact with operators (`+`, `-`, etc.) and built-in functions (`len()`, `str()`, etc.), enabling a more intuitive and readable way of working with custom objects.\n",
