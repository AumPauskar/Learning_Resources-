    "# Using SQLite with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a lightweight and embedded relational database management system that is easy to use and requires minimal configuration. It is a popular choice for small to medium-sized applications, especially when portability and simplicity are essential. Python provides a built-in module called `sqlite3` that allows you to interact with SQLite databases seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing SQLite and Python\n",
    "2. Connecting to a SQLite database\n",
    "3. Creating tables and inserting data\n",
    "4. Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\n",
    "5. Executing advanced queries (Joins, Aggregates, Subqueries)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the details:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Datatypes in SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQLite, data types determine the type of value that can be stored in each column of a table. SQLite is a dynamically typed database, which means it is more flexible with data types compared to traditional statically typed databases. Here are the main data types used in SQLite:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NULL**: A special data type representing a NULL value (empty or missing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **INTEGER**: An integer value (whole numbers) stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **REAL**: A floating-point value used to store floating-point numbers like decimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TEXT**: A text string, which can store any alphanumeric characters, dates, or strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **BLOB**: Binary Large Object, used to store binary data such as images, documents, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **NUMERIC**: This data type can store any type of numeric value (integer or floating-point) as well as dates and timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is not strict with data types, which means you can store data of different types in the same column. SQLite uses dynamic typing to determine the affinity of a value stored in a column based on the value's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you insert an integer value into a column, SQLite will assign INTEGER affinity to that column, but you can still insert a text value in the same column, and SQLite will convert it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of creating a table with different data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE my_table (\n",
    "    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name TEXT,\n",
    "    age INTEGER,\n",
    "    height REAL,\n",
    "    bio BLOB\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have a table named `my_table` with columns of different data types: `id` (INTEGER), `name` (TEXT), `age` (INTEGER), `height` (REAL), and `bio` (BLOB).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while SQLite is flexible with data types, it is still recommended to follow good database design practices and use appropriate data types for each column to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installing SQLite and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is already included in the Python standard library, so you don't need to install anything separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Connecting to a SQLite database\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with SQLite in Python, you need to import the `sqlite3` module and connect to the database. If the specified database does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to a database (if it doesn't exist, it will be created)\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object to interact with the database\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Creating tables and inserting data\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to define the table schema before inserting data. A schema includes the table name, column names, and their data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a table\n",
    "cursor.execute('''\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n",
    "        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
    "        age INTEGER\n",
    "    )\n",
    "''')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert data into the table\n",
    "cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)', ('John Doe', 30))\n",
    "cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)', ('Jane Smith', 25))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save changes to the database\n",
    "conn.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Performing CRUD operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Read data (SELECT)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# SELECT all rows\n",
    "cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')\n",
    "rows = cursor.fetchall()  # Fetch all rows\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# SELECT with conditions\n",
    "cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?', (25,))\n",
    "rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Update data (UPDATE)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Update data\n",
    "cursor.execute('UPDATE users SET age = ? WHERE name = ?', (35, 'John Doe'))\n",
    "conn.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. Insert data (CREATE)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert data into the table\n",
    "cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)', ('Mary Johnson', 28))\n",
    "conn.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4. Delete data (DELETE)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Delete data\n",
    "cursor.execute('DELETE FROM users WHERE name = ?', ('Jane Smith',))\n",
    "conn.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Executing advanced queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1. Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create additional tables\n",
    "cursor.execute('''\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (\n",
    "        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        user_id INTEGER,\n",
    "        product TEXT,\n",
    "        price REAL\n",
    "    )\n",
    "''')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert data into orders table\n",
    "cursor.execute('INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (1, 'Product A', 19.99))\n",
    "cursor.execute('INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (2, 'Product B', 12.50))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform INNER JOIN between users and orders\n",
    "cursor.execute('''\n",
    "    SELECT users.name, orders.product\n",
    "    FROM users\n",
    "    INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id\n",
    "''')\n",
    "rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2. Aggregates\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate average age of users\n",
    "cursor.execute('SELECT AVG(age) FROM users')\n",
    "average_age = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n",
    "print(\"Average age:\", average_age)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Count the number of orders for each user\n",
    "cursor.execute('''\n",
    "    SELECT users.name, COUNT(orders.id) AS num_orders\n",
    "    FROM users\n",
    "    LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id\n",
    "    GROUP BY users.name\n",
    "''')\n",
    "rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3. Subqueries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get users with orders above the average price\n",
    "cursor.execute('''\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM users\n",
    "    WHERE id IN (\n",
    "        SELECT user_id\n",
    "        FROM orders\n",
    "        WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM orders)\n",
    "    )\n",
    "''')\n",
    "rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to commit the changes using `conn.commit()` whenever you modify the database. Also, close the connection and cursor after you're done working with the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This covers the basics of using SQLite with Python and executing different types of queries. Always ensure proper error handling and data validation to create robust and secure applications.\n"
