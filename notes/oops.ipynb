    "# Class\n",
    "A class is a template for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines the data and behavior associated with instances of that class2. In general, a class can contain member variables (data) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data. When you create an object from a class, you are instantiating the class and creating an instance of it with its own set of data and behavior.\n",

    "# Object\n",
    "An object is anything that has a fixed shape or form, that you can touch or see, and that is not alive1. In computer science, an object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors.\n",
