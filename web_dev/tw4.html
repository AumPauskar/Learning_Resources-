        Mattia Binotto has resigned as Ferrari team principal. The Italian team
        appeared to be in contention to end its long wait for titles after a
        strong start to the 2022 season, but failed to win any of the final 11
        races of the campaign amid a loss of performance, and finished a distant
        second to Red Bull in the constructors' championship. While Ferrari
        ultimately did not have the pace to compete with Red Bull, the
        combination of reliability issues and repeated strategy errors saw
        Binotto come under pressure, with rumours surfacing ahead of the season
        finale in Abu Dhabi that he would be dismissed. At the time, Ferrari
        said reports that Binotto would be sacked were "totally without
        foundation", but less than two weeks after that denial, the team
        released a statement confirming the 53-year-old's departure. Binotto
        will leave his role on December 31, bringing a three-year reign at the
        head of Formula 1's most famous team to an end, as well as a 28-year
        career in total having risen through the ranks."With the regret that
        this entails, I have decided to conclude my collaboration with Ferrari,"
        said Binotto, who had previously insisted he was going to stay for 2023.
        "I am leaving a company that I love, which I have been part of for 28
        years, with the serenity that comes from the conviction that I have made
        every effort to achieve the objectives set. "I leave a united and
        growing team. A strong team, ready, I'm sure, to achieve the highest
        goals, to which I wish all the best for the future. I think it is right
        to take this step at this time as hard as this decision has been for me.
        "I would like to thank all the people at the Gestione Sportiva who have
        shared this journey with me, made up of difficulties but also of great
        satisfaction." Ferrrai CEO Benedetto Vigna added:
        <b
          >"I would like to thank Mattia for his many great contributions over
          28 years with Ferrari and particularly for leading the team back to a
          position of competitiveness during this past year. As a result, we are
          in a strong position to renew our challenge, above all for our amazing
          fans around the world, to win the ultimate prize in motorsport.
          Everyone here at the Scuderia and in the wider Ferrari community
          wishes Mattia well for the future."
        </b>
        Binotto presided over Ferrari's infamous 2019 campaign, which the team
        contested with an engine later deemed to have been illegal by the FIA.
        That led to a private settlement between the governing body and Ferrari.
        Although it remains unknown what the settlement entailed, Ferrari
        suffered a dramatic drop in form over the next two seasons. It's failure
        to compete for the title in 2022 was a clear source of irritation to
        superstar driver Charles Leclerc, who regularly voiced concerns with
        Ferrari's strategy during races in the latter part of the season. Were
        Ferrari to appoint Vasseur it could be seen as a way to appease
        Leclerc's bubbling frustrations -- Vasseur oversaw Leclerc's rookie
        season at Alfa Romeo in 2018 and is a well respected figure in the
        paddock. Vasseur worked with Ferrari's star driver Charles Leclerc when
        he was a rookie in 2018. Leclerc grew increasingly frustrated with
        Ferrari this season and was often heard questioning the team's strategy
        during races.
